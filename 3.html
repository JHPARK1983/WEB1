<h2>JAVA</h2>
<p>
Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based, object-oriented,
and designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers write once,
run anywhere (WORA),[15] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support
Java without the need for recompilation.[16] Java applications are typically compiled
to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture.
The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. As of 2019,
Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub,[17][18] particularly for client-server web applications,
with a reported 9 million developers.[
